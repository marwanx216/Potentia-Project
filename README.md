<b> Use case: </b> 

Movalytics is a movie company that is currently facing challenges with their operations. They find themselves spending a significant amount of money on movie productions, but the total income generated from these movies falls short of their expected targets. In response, the company's managers have decided to conduct a thorough analysis to identify the root cause of this issue. However, during their analysis, they realized that their existing data is not in a suitable format nor designed for in-depth analysis. To address this, they have made a decision to hire a skilled data engineer. The primary goal is to develop a robust data warehouse tailored to their business needs. This data warehouse will facilitate easy analysis and provide the necessary infrastructure for capturing valuable insights that can help identify the problem and propose effective solutions.
